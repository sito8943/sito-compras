# Security Policy

Our project is committed to ensuring a secure environment for all users. We encourage and value any contributions or reports related to security vulnerabilities. This policy outlines the procedures for reporting vulnerabilities, as well as our approach to addressing and managing them.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, we kindly request that you report it to our team immediately. To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Submission:** Please submit a detailed report of the vulnerability via email. Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and any relevant details.

2. **Responsible Disclosure:** We appreciate responsible disclosure and kindly request that you allow us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before publicly disclosing any details.

3. **Cooperation:** We encourage collaboration and welcome any additional information or guidance you can provide to assist in resolving the vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Response and Resolution

We are committed to promptly addressing reported vulnerabilities and taking the necessary steps to resolve them. Here is our approach:

1. **Assessment:** Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will assess the issue and verify its validity.

2. **Resolution:** Once validated, we will work diligently to develop and implement an appropriate fix for the vulnerability.

3. **Communication:** We will maintain open and transparent communication with the reporter throughout the resolution process, providing updates on the progress and expected timelines for fixes.

4. **Versioning Policy:** Updates addressing security vulnerabilities will be released promptly following a fix. We adhere to semantic versioning ([Learn more](https://semver.org/)) to indicate the impact of changes:

    - **Patch Releases:** These are reserved for security updates addressing vulnerabilities without impacting existing functionality. Users are encouraged to update to the latest patch release within the same major version.

    - **Minor/Major Releases:** These include additional features or significant changes and may also include security updates. Users are advised to review release notes and upgrade accordingly based on the impact and backward compatibility.

## Supported Versions

We maintain security updates for the following versions:

-   **Major Version 1.0.2:** All patch releases within this major version will receive security updates and patches.

We encourage users to regularly update to the latest versions to benefit from security enhancements and fixes.
